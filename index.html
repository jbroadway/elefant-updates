The release update checking in the Elefant admin toolbar will check the corresponding
file in this folder for the latest update for that major/minor version. For example,
a site running Elefant 1.1.0 will check /updates/1.1.json to see if there's a newer
release. If it contains a newer release, the site owner will be notified that an
update is available.
